# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

# The challenge
My challenge is to build out this coming soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

users can be able to:

# . View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
# . See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
# . Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
  # . The input field is empty
  # . The email address is not formatted correctly
Have fun building! ðŸš€
